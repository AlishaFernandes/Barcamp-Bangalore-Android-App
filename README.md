# Want to contribute?

GitHub has some great articles on [how to get started with Git and GitHub](http://help.github.com/) and how to [fork a project](http://help.github.com/forking/).

Contributers are recommended to fork the app on GitHub (but don't have too). Create a feature branch, push the branch to git hub, press Pull Request and write a simple explanation.

One fix per commit. If say a a commit closes the open issue 12. Just add `closes #12` in your commit message to close that issue automagically.

All code that is contributed must be compliant with [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

For any questions that you have regards to this pleas shoot in a mail at [Barcamp Bangalore Mailing List](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/bangalore_barcamp/)

## Code Style Guidelines

Contributers are recommended to follow the Android [Code Style Guidelines](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) with exception for line length that I try to hold to 80 columns where possible.

In short that is;

* Indentation: tabs, no spaces
* Line length: 80 columns
* Braces: Opening braces don't go on their own line.
* Acronyms are words: Treat acronyms as words in names, yielding XmlHttpRequest, getUrl(), etc.
* Consistency: Look at what's around you!

Have fun and remember we do this in our spare time so don't be too serious :)
