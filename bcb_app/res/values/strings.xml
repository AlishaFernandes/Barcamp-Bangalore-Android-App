    <string name="about_message">Its been around five years now since Bangalore 
        saw its first Barcamp. Over this period, the city’s flagship technology unconference
        has brought together hundreds of professionals who have participated in dozens of
         sessions to share their insights on cutting edge technologies.\n\n
         
		With the success of the Barcamp format, we have seen the emergence of several other
		exciting unconferences targeting a range of technology niches. In this changed
		context, we are seeking to create a uniquely useful space for geeks to come
		together while perfectly complementing similar events in the city.\n\n
		
		For BCB, we request that participants submit topics prior to the event to
		ensure that a majority of a session is devoted discussions. We also hope 
		that BCB’s venue at SAP Labs will encourage spontaneous and open-ended 
		interaction among participants like last time.\n\n

    <string name="sampletext">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>
